# Bachelorthesis
This repository started as my Bachelorthesis in theoretical Chemistry and developed further.
A Python Programm with Hartree-Fock(RHF,UHF,ROHF) Pertubation-Theory(MP2,MP3) and Coupled Cluster(CCD) is already done.
Currently I am working on a Julia Programm in Multireference-Theory(CI,MCSCF).
